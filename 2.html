<h2>Nebula</h2>
<p>A nebula ('cloud' or 'fog' in Latin;[1] pl: nebulae, nebul√¶ or nebulas[2][3][4][5]) is a distinct luminescent part of interstellar medium, which can consist of ionized, neutral, or molecular hydrogen and also cosmic dust. Nebulae are often star-forming regions, such as in the "Pillars of Creation" in the Eagle Nebula. In these regions, the formations of gas, dust, and other materials "clump" together to form denser regions, which attract further matter and eventually become dense enough to form stars. The remaining material is then thought to form planets and other planetary system objects. However, scientifically, it is unclear as to where the original matter came from; as energy is not created or destroyed (see the first law of thermodynamics).
